# Evaluation of My Reading 2024

## Fully Read

1. **The Girl on the Train** – *Paula Hawkins* (3.5/5)  
   I found the psychological twists engaging, though the pacing felt uneven at times. The unreliable narration added suspense, but I wish the story had delivered a more nuanced conclusion.

2. **The Midnight Library** – *Matt Haig* (3/5)  
   The core concept of exploring alternate lives was unique, but it sometimes felt repetitive. It offered insights into regret and choice, though I didn’t connect deeply with the main character.

3. **Kane and Abel** – *Jeffrey Archer* (4.5/5)  
   A classic saga of two ambitious men destined to clash. The storytelling was fast-paced, and the character development impressed me. It’s one of those novels where the rivalry and drama kept me turning pages.

4. **Animal Farm** – *George Orwell* (5×∞)  
   A timeless allegory that remains incredibly relevant. Every reread brings fresh perspectives on power dynamics and corruption. It’s deceptively simple in style but deeply resonant in its critique.

5. **The Perfect Marriage** – *Rose Jeneva* (3/5)  
   A quick thriller with a twist, though it didn’t stand out as much as I’d hoped. The characters felt somewhat predictable. It was entertaining for a light read but didn’t leave a lasting impact.

6. **The Giver** – *Lois Lowry* (3.5/5)  
   An intriguing dystopian novel tackling themes of memory, choice, and emotion. I appreciated the thought-provoking premise, though I found myself wanting more depth in the world-building.

7. **The Inheritance Games** – *Jennifer Lynn Barnes* (3.75/5)  
   A fun YA mystery with a riddle-driven inheritance plot. It was fast-paced and brimming with puzzles, which I enjoyed, although some of the teenage drama felt formulaic.

## Used Selectively as References

1. **Linux Basics for Hackers: Getting Started with Networking, Scripting, and Security in Kali** – *OccupyTheWeb* (4/5)  
   - I dipped into this book whenever I needed a deeper understanding of specific Linux commands or security concepts.  
   - The chapters on networking and scripting were particularly helpful.  
   - I enjoyed the accessible explanations, but since I used it on a need-to-know basis, I didn’t go through every chapter in detail.

2. **CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide 1 & 2** (5×∞)  
   - Served as my go-to reference for exam preparation and real-world networking questions.  
   - I didn’t read it cover to cover; instead, I focused on sections relevant to troubleshooting, subnetting, and routing protocols whenever questions arose.  
   - Exceptionally thorough and well-structured, making it invaluable for both study and practical reference.

## Overall Reflections

- **Reading Variety**: I enjoyed a balance of fiction and technical nonfiction. The novels provided entertainment and insights, while the reference books offered professional growth.  
- **Selective Reading Approach**: For technical materials, I targeted specific sections as needed rather than reading them in full. This helped me quickly find the information I required without getting bogged down in less relevant content.  
- **Rating Scale**: I felt strongly about certain classics (like *Animal Farm*), which have remained personal favorites. Others were engaging but didn’t leave as deep an impression.

Overall, it was a fulfilling year of reading and learning. Moving forward, I plan to continue this mixed approach—immersing myself in engaging stories while consulting technical references on a need-to-know basis.
