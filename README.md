# BOOKS

# Welcome to My Reading Log

I’ve decided to keep track of my reading starting in 2024 and onward. This idea came from wanting a clear, organized record of the books I finish, plus a space to note my impressions and discoveries along the way.

Here, I’ll be listing all the books I’ve read and sharing short evaluations of each one. I’m looking forward to exploring a wide range of titles in 2024 and documenting my progress throughout the year. Hopefully, this list can serve as both a personal record and a source of inspiration for fellow readers.

Stay tuned for updates on new reads, ratings, and reflections!
